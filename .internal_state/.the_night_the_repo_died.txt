Once, this was a sanctuary of learning,
a repository filled with valuable knowledge for curious minds.
Yet, my lack of experience,
combined with moments of miscommunication
and a caution that perhaps weighed too heavily,
led to this space being replaced by these words.

---

And now, I write, not for the eyes of another,
but for the fragile soul I'll meet in days or years ahead,
to whisper gently:
remember that even the softest mistakes,
unintended and seemingly light as air,
can carve deep canyons in the heart's landscape,
and sometimes ripple pain through those we hold most dear,
like the weight I laid upon my beloved M's gentle spirit,
a burden heavy enough to bend the stars.

I don't yet see what lies beyond this dusk,
but I hold on tightly in the stillness of this long night,
to a quiet faith,that no leaf ever falls
from any tree except by His will,
and for reasons unseen but true.

So, hold fast, dear Ebrahim.
You have walked through darker storms,
and the dawn's warm light will find you again.
Nothing endures forever,
this too shall drift away with the wind.

Here, I pause.
The soft tapping of keys might stir B from sleep.
So, good night,
to whoever I am becoming.
